Instructions

This week we'll be updating our Nightruder Pages.

Make sure the page from last week is validated, and spell checked.

Check your assignment last week for comments for HTML/CSS updates.

If you haven't yet, make sure your site supports a mobile view option via either a media query, well-formatted liquid design (please check), or a/several content query(queries).

Add your name and the current date at the top of every file as a comment.

Publish the completed web page to the student web server in a folder named 'week-two' and post the URL to your web page here.

Exercises (complete these JavaScript exercises in the same web page.  Use JavaScript comments to identify where you have completed each step.  Add scripts to just before the closing </body> element. )

 

Your page should currently have an alert that delivers a message about Nightruder. Save that message string as a variable that can be changed named greeting.
Change your alert to alert the variable greeting.
Reassign the value of greeting to be a new message about Nightruder
Since we'll using console.log() to test our work and deliver messages to ourselves, go ahead and log the new value of greeting to console.
Create an adaptable boolean variable called readyToLaunch, and save a value to indicate the game is not ready for launch.
Create two number values that can be changed called preorders with a value of 4538 and promoCopies at 22. Create a third variable with a constant value called retailPrice of 79
console log a statement that will reflect the values of the variables in this sentence: "Nightruder has preorders preorders, looking at $retailPrice * (preorders - promoCopies) in sales."
8.  Unrelated to Nightruder, but just for now: In the script, console.log each of these expressions (they are found at the end of the Type Conversions lesson) Make sure you understand these!  The + operator is the tricky one given it will NOT convert a string. Literally just console.log() each step individually and observe what it does to these values. This'll be a moment for reflection of how type conversion works.
